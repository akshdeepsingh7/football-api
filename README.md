# Football League Standings

This project scrapes the latest standings of major football leagues and updates this README automatically with a Markdown table. It also provides a JSON file for programmatic access.

---

## JSON API

The latest standings are saved in a JSON file, which you can access directly:

- **Link:** [standings.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akshdeepsingh7/football-api/refs/heads/main/standings.json)  

You can use this JSON file as an API to fetch the latest league standings programmatically.
